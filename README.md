# Force-HTTPS-for-Website

This is a simple script I found somewhere on the web a while back that when added to an existing HTACCESS file or  when used in a newly created .HTACCESS file it will force your site to redirect to HTTPS from HTTP.

To use, simply copy the code in the attached file and add to your .HTACCESS file or create a new .HTACCESS file with the attached code.

I do not own this code nor did I create it.
